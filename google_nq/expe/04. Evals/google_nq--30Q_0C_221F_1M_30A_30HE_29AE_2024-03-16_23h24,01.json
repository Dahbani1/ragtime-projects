The IOC had adopted a rule that made any player who had signed an NHL contract but played less than ten games in the league eligible (2). However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play (3). The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, as long as they had not played in any NHL games (4). This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible (5). Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the World Hockey Association—were allowed to play (6). Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs (7).

Between 1969 and 1980, imported Dogues de Bordeaux in the USA were scarce, limited to a few breeders who worked closely with the French Dogue de Bordeaux Club, the SADB. The breed was first 'officially' introduced to American purebred enthusiasts in an article written in 1982 and by the American anthropologist, Dr. Carl Semencic for 'Dog World' magazine. That article, entitled 'Introducing the Dogue de Bordeaux', was followed by chapters dedicated to the Dogue in Semencic's books on dogs, published by T.F.H. Publications of Neptune, New Jersey. When Semencic's first article on the breed was published, there were no Bordeaux Dogues in the United States. There were 600 examples left in the world, mostly in France, the Netherlands and ast Berlin, and the breed's numbers were on the decline. Much later, in 1989, the typical American family saw the Dogue de Bordeaux for the first time on the big screen in Touchstone's movie Turner & Hooch about a policeman and his canine partner, although many people [who?] did not know that the massive slobbering animal was a Dogue de Bordeaux.",
